# BookStore Database Project

## Project Description
MySQL database for a bookstore management system implementing all required tables and relationships.

## Database Structure
- Contains 15 tables for complete bookstore operations (books, authors, customers, orders, etc.)
- Proper relationships established with foreign keys
- Sample data for testing all functionality
- User management with appropriate privileges

## Setup Instructions
1. Run schema.sql to create tables
2. Run sample_data.sql to populate with test data
3. Run users.sql to set up database users with proper permissions

## Expected Outcomes
What you'll gain by completing this SQL project:

- **Database Design & Implementation**: Designed and implemented a MySQL database for a real-world bookstore use case, with proper normalization and relationships.

- **Schema Optimization**: Created tables with optimal schema design and appropriate data types for each dataset, ensuring data integrity and performance.

- **Security Management**: Implemented database security through user groups and roles with specific privileges, following security best practices.

- **Data Analysis**: Developed queries to extract meaningful insights from the database, demonstrating practical SQL querying skills.

- **Project Documentation**: Produced comprehensive documentation including database schema, sample data, and query examples.
